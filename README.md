## React-Native App

This project is a learning project based on [React-Native Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ixPU-QkScoRBVxtPPzVjrQ) course of The Net Ninja.

**What I learned:**
* React-Native in general;
  * using Expo;
  * creating components;
  * stack and drawer navigation between screens;
  * React hooks using and updating states on function based components;
  * creating modal;
* using [Formik](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik#readme) to create input form;
* using [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) to validate user's input.

**How to use the app?**

In order to see this application you have to install [Expo](https://expo.io).

1. Download/clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `expo start`.
